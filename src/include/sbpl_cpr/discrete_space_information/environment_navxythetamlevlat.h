 *	       In other words, it is for doing collision checking in 3D (x,y,z). The z
 *	       level is split into numofzlevs levels. If numofzlevs = 1, then it
 *	       defaults to the original x,y,theta lattice planning defined in
 *	       EnvironmentNAVXYTHETALAT. Otherwise, it uses numofzlevs footprints of the
 *	       robot and corresponding costmaps. It assumes that they correspond to each
 *	       other and are projections of the robot and corresponding z regions of the
 *	       3D map.
